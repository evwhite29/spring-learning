# Spring Learning Toy Project

This purpose of this project is to follow along with the Spring 
Framework+Hibernate tutorial course that can be found 
[here](https://www.udemy.com/spring-hibernate-tutorial) on Udemy.

The course takes you through working with the different capabilites
of the Spring Framework as well as the options for each capability,
such as XML configuration vs. annotation-based configuration vs.
Java-based configuration.

The author does not use Maven or any other build tool. Instead, they
opt to just include the JARs that they need. I decided to prefer Maven
instead and used it here to manage the required dependencies.
